Case Study
 
A superstore retail business is a large, multi-department store that sells various products, including groceries, electronics, home goods, clothing, and more. These stores are often designed to be a one-stop shop for customers, offering a wide range of products and services under one roof. Superstores are typically larger than traditional retail stores and may have a larger product selection. Superstores are often part of a larger chain and have multiple locations in a region or country.
